# Retain
Retain is a versatile language learning app aimed at making vocabulary memorization more fun, efficient, and effective. 

Memorizing long vocabulary lists with repetitive flash cards is boring, tedious, and not always productive.  Retain uses fun but soothing colors 
and a memory-matching game to not only make vocabulary learning more interactive but mentally-stimulating and sustainable in the long term.

## How to Play
Visit the website in the description of this repo. Create an account and login.

After selecting one of the three available sets and clicking ‘START’, twelve light red cards will be populated with vocabulary words, and 
the memory matching game will have begun. 

Whenever you click on a card, it turns light turquoise. When you click on two cards with the same meaning, they turn to a darker shade of turquoise, 
and thus become unclickable. Select the English counterpart to each Spanish word to win. 

See Tab 2 if unfamiliar with Spanish (game won’t end). You may give up by either clicking the red back button, or the QUIT button.


### Common Game Play Mistakes

There are two very important rules that must be followed in order to play the game correctly:

1. You may only select two cards at once. If you try to select a third card, nothing will happen.

    ![rule1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55061982/207167121-8a16b93c-502e-400b-8163-b23c716f5d6b.gif)
    
    In this gif, I select _rojo_ and _orange_, then try to select _green_, but nothing happens.

2. After selecting two cards and you find that they don’t match, you have to deselect them **both** in order to select two new cards.
   You can’t select two cards, deselect one, then try to select another one. 

    ![rule2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55061982/207167516-a50041f5-59c2-4915-a384-dc6d4b06511d.gif)
    
    In this gif, I select _azul_ and _green_, which don’t match. Then I deselect _green_, keeping _azul_ still clicked, and try to select _verde_. 
    This won’t work. I must deselect **both** _azul_ and _green_ in order to then be able to select two new cards.

## Version Details 

This is a pseudo version of what a completed Retain app would be.

The clicking functionality obviously needs work to be less confusing. In addition, the current version of the app comes preset with three sets of 
basic Spanish vocab words, but a future ideal version of the app that would allow users to create their own sets and even organize them into folders. 
It might also be interesting to implement a timed version of the game, where the user would have to beat the clock to win.
